''' There are two players, Alice and Bob, each with a 3-by-3 grid. A referee tells Alice to fill out one particluar
    row in the grid(say the second row) by putting either a 1 or a 0 in each box, such that the sum of the numbers in 
    that row is odd. The referee tells Bob to fill out one column in the grid(say the first column) by puttint either a
    1 or a 0 in each box, such that the sum of the numbers in the column is even. 

    Alice and Bob win the game if Alice's number given an odd sum, Bob's give an even sum, and (most important) they've
    each written down the same number in the one square where their row and column intersect.'''
